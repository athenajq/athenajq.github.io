            <p>In an emergency, dial 911 for immediate crisis help.</p>
            <p class="911-info" style="display: none">
                If you dial 911, make sure to be specific about the crisis and provide as much information as possible
                so officers can respond appropriately. Emphasize that it is a mental health crisis. Request a CIT
                (Crisis Intervention Team) officer if available. For more information about when/what to dial 911, look
                into <a class="links" target="_blank"

            <p class="911-info" style="display: none">
                According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness <a class="links" target="_blank"

                the police can help someone voluntarily go to the hospital for help or force someone to involuntarily
                get a mental health evaluation at the hospital (varies from state to state).
            </p>
            <p class="911-info" style="display: none">
            Keep in mind that 911 may not fit your exact situation. According to <a class="links" target="_blank"

                research</a>,
            your local 911 dispatch may not be properly equipped to handle mental health crises and often result in
            law enforcement response. As mentioned above, this could result in involuntary hospitalization or
            transportation to a psychiatric ward. There are also local non-emergency lines. You can find your
            closest one in <a class="links" target="_blank"

            <p>988 is the suicide and crisis lifeline. It’s the new number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
            </p>
            <p class="988-info" style="display: none">This line will connect you to trained counselors that will “listen, understand how [caller’s] problems

            <p class="988-info" style="display: none">It’s also important to note that certain calls to 988 can be routed to 911 (SAMHSA states this occurs
                only to a small percentage). In that case, it’s possible that law enforcement will respond. This could
                result in involuntary intervention with concerns mentioned under the “Dial 911” section. That’s why some
                mental health advocates recommend calling warmlines, less intrusive numbers you can call for help in
                non-emergencies. <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://warmline.org/">Here is a warmline

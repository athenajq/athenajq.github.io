            <p>If you, a family member, or a friend are in need of help, here are a list of resources you can use.
                Note that all resources are for informational purposes only. The list is not comprehensive, and links

            <h1>Call 911</h1>
            <p>In an emergency, call 911 for immediate crisis help.</p>
            <p>
                If you call 911, make sure to be specific about the crisis and provide as much information as possible
                so officers can respond appropriately. Emphasize that it is a mental health crisis. Request a CIT
                (Crisis Intervention Team) officer if available. For more information about when/what to call 911, look
                into <a class="links"
                    href="https://reddotalert.com/managing-a-mental-health-crisis-when-should-you-call-911/">this
                    RedDot article.</a></p>
            <p>
                According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness <a class="links"
                    href="https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey/Family-Members-and-Caregivers/Calling-911-and-Talking-with-Police">NAMI</a>,
                the police can help someone voluntarily go to the hospital for help or force someone to involuntarily
                get a mental health evaluation at the hospital (varies from state to state).
            </p>
            Keep in mind that 911 may not fit your exact situation. According to <a class="links"
                href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2021/10/new-research-suggests-911-call-centers-lack-resources-to-handle-behavioral-health-crises">PEW
                research</a>,
            your local 911 dispatch may not be properly equipped to handle mental health crises and often result in
            law enforcement response. As mentioned above, this could result in involuntary hospitalization or
            transportation to a psychiatric ward. There are also local non-emergency lines. You can find your
            closest one in <a class="links"
                href="https://www.police1.com/resources/articles/non-emergency-police-phone-numbers-6MpSCmo7w3SdRciS/">this
                directory.</a>
            </p>

            <h1>Call 988</h1>
            <p>988 is the suicide and crisis lifeline. It’s the new number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
            </p>
            <p>This line will connect you to trained counselors that will “listen, understand how [caller’s] problems
                are affecting them, provide support, and connect [callers] to resources if necessary<a class="links"
                    href="https://988lifeline.org/current-events/the-lifeline-and-988/">(Lifeline).</a>
                For more information, look into <a class="links"
                    href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/faqs">SAMHSA’s FAQ
                    page.</a></p>
            <p>It’s also important to note that certain calls to 988 can be routed to 911 (SAMHSA states this occurs
                only to a small percentage). In that case, it’s possible that law enforcement will respond. This could
                result in involuntary intervention with concerns mentioned under the “Call 911” section. That’s why some
                mental health advocates recommend calling warmlines, less intrusive numbers you can call for help in
                non-emergencies. <a class="links" href="https://warmline.org/">Here is a warmline directory
                    resource.</a></p>
            <h1>Lifeline Chat</h1>
            <p>988’s website has a lifeline chat built into its web for free and confidential support.</p>
            <h1>Text 741741</h1>
            <p>Text “HELLO” or “HOME” to 741741 to get support from a trained crisis counselor.</p>
            <h1>Call 1-(800)-622-HELP (4357)</h1>
            <p>Call 1-(800)-622-HELP for SAMHSA’s (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) national
                helpline for free, confidential support. </p>
            <h1>Warm Lines</h1>
            <p>Call warm lines, which you can find through <a href="https://warmline.org">this directory</a> or <a
                    href="https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/">this one</a>, for
                non-emergency, early intervention. </p>
            <p>Warm lines are ‘peer-run’ and will connect callers to a listening line of people who are also in mental
                health recovery. They’ll allow you to speak and receive support, confidentially and for free. </p>
            <p>Some warm lines are only available during set hours. Some warm lines may also only let you speak for a
                certain time limit (like an hour). Others are available 24/7 and have unlimited call times. </p>
